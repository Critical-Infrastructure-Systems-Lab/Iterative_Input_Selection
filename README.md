MATLAB_IterativeInputSelection_with_Rtree-c
===========================================

The MATLAB_IterativeInputSelection toolbox is a MatLab implementation of the Iterative Input Selection (IIS) algorithm proposed by Galelli and Castelletti (2013). The underlying model (i.e. Extremely Randomized Trees) are implemented in a more computationally efficient code.
